# SmartThings Space Weather Device Type
This is a simple Space Weather device type for SmartThings.  It polls data from NOAA's excellent <a href='http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/'>Space Weather Prediction Center</a> and formats the data into simple attributes.

In part, this device type serves as a proof of concept to push forward new capabilities and attributes through the SmartThings design process.

In 2011, NOAA refined its early warning systems so that solar storm warnings would fit into three categories.  

* Geomagnetic Storms are ranked on a scale of G0 to G5, with G5 being the most severe storms occurring just once every 40-50 years.  During G5 storms, some power grids will experience blackouts and aurora can be seen as far south as Florida.
* Solar Radiation Storms are ranked on a scale of S0 to S5, with S5 storms occurring just once every 10-20 years.  Polar blackouts of high-frequency communications, and elevated radiation risks occur. 
* Radio Blackouts are ranked on a scale of R0 to R5, with R5 blackouts occurring once every 10-20 years.  During an R5 blackout, radio blackouts are expected on the sunlit side of the Earth, as well as loss of GPS for most of the network during the duration of the storm.

Fortunately, our current solar weather outlook appears calm!
